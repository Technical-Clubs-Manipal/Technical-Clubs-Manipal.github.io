New layout

Issues:
1. We need transparent png logos of all the clubs
2. Nmes of technical clubs in technicalclubs page are too big, messing up the responsiveness in mobile
3. The heading still says technical clubs in MIT, then 3 types student projects, TECHNICAL CLUBS, student chapters. 

Possibilities:
1. If we figure out a backend we can add a form as well where people can post queries or messages
2. If a team/club wants to elaborate on their project or are looking for more space we can give them a new webpage where they can write everything they want and link it to the original tiles we have already
