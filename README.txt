New layout

Issues:
1. We need transparent png logos of all the clubs
2. The clubs which do not have a website, maybe we can add the link to the facebook or remove the learn more button
3. There is a div at the end of each page similar to letter by technical secretary on the home page which can be removed or something inspiring or something else can be added.
4. At the top of each page there should be a general discription with something motivating the top box or that needs to be removed

Possibilities:
1. If we figure out a backend we can add a form as well where people can post queries or messages
2. If a team/club wants to elaborate on their project or are looking for more space we can give them a new webpage where they can write everything they want and link it to the original tiles we have already
