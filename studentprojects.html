										<h2>Sed amet aliquam</h2>
									</header> 
									<p>We all know how important technical knowledge is; but what is even more important is its practicality. Keeping this in mind, MIT came up with an idea of Major Student Projects in 2007. It provided the necessary infrastructure to build a technical project to compete in international competitions. Formula Manipal was the first such project that aimed at the designing, fabrication and racing a single seater, open wheel Formula style race car. It's success led to the initiation of many other student projects. These projects help enhance communication, leadership, teamwork, problem solving, planning, motivation, adaptability and ability to build relationships among other skills in the students, that are crucial in the professional life. These help the students think out of the box and keeps them up-to-date with the latest technical advancements throughout the world.</p>
